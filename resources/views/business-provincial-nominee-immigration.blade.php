                Provincial Nominee Immigration or Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP) is a network of varied programs that run
                across Canada, supported by almost all provinces and territories. These programs allow these provinces to
                nominate skilled workers as candidates to be allowed into Canada. This varies for what skills are required
                in each economy that is nominating these skilled workers.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>SPONSORED EMPLOYEES</h3>

                For some of these programs, the employer nominates their candidates and after approval from the province,
                are run through an expedited process. The early stages see these skilled workers obtain temporary work
                permits to enter Canada while simultaneously being processed for permanent residence. Outside of a few
                provinces (Saskatchewan, Quebec and Manitoba), skilled based provincial programs usually need an employer to
                sponsor an applicant. Without government approval by said province, the application will be denied. This is
                usually caused when an employer does not have approval for sponsorship by the government.
                <br>
                <br>

                Sponsoring employers must show efforts to hire local workers and meet varied terms and conditions that exist
                in the occupation. These efforts help qualify foreign workers, and is sometimes labeled a transition plan.
                To become a sponsored employee, skill level must meet Type 0 or Skill Level A/B on the National Occupation
                Classification (NOC).

                <h3>Saskatchewan</h3>

                <strong>Saskatchewan has a set of immigration routes that allow foreign persons to become permanent
                    residents of Canada. The PNP is intentionally designed to recruit immigrants who would benefit the
                    province, such as skilled workers, workers in industries with labour shortages, employees with job
                    offers, and entrepreneurs. The province has many immigration channels grouped into three
                    categories:</strong>

                <ul class="inner2">
                    <li>
                        <h3>Saskatchewan International Worker</h3>
                        This category aimed at skilled individuals who can readily integrate into Saskatchewan's workforce
                        and adjust to life in the province. Some streams favour employees with experience in industries with
                        labour shortages, while others target workers with job offers from Saskatchewan firms. The streams
                        in Saskatchewan International Worker include: Saskatchewan Express Entry, Saskatchewan Employment
                        Offer and Saskatchewan In-Demand Occupation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Saskatchewan Experience</h3>
                        The Saskatchewan Experience looks at workers who have an offer of employment in Saskatchewan. They
                        must also have previous work experience in the province. Some streams may prioritize workers with
                        experience in certain sectors for reasons such as labour shortages. The streams in Saskatchewan
                        Experience include: Saskatchewan Existing Work Permit, Saskatchewan Health Professionals,
                        Saskatchewan Hospitality Sector Project, Saskatchewan Long-Haul Truck Driver Project and
                        Saskatchewan Students.

                        <h3>Saskatchewan Entrepreneur and Farm</h3>
                        Saskatchewan Entrepreneur and Farm is a set of two immigration streams targeted for people with
                        business management experience who want to start a new enterprise in Saskatchewan. The
                        entrepreneurial stream is intended for general entrepreneurs with business plans in a variety of
                        areas, whereas the farm owner and operator stream are intended exclusively for farmers. The two
                        streams are: Saskatchewan Entrepreneur and Saskatchewan Farm Owners and Operators.
